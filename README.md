## Development Process

The entire application is developed using generative AI. The purpose of this application is to learn and evaluate generative AI tools for writing software.

The work is divided into a series of lessons:
- In each lesson, we develop one feature at some state of the application.
- The goal of each lesson is to apply the generative AI tools to develop the requested feature.

By following this structured approach, we aim to explore the capabilities and limitations of generative AI in software development.

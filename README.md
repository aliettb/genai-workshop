# Money Flow Application

## Purpose

**Money Flow** is a web application designed to help businesses manage their customer relationships and financial transactions efficiently.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Multiple users can sign in to the application.
- **Customer Management**: Users can track their customers and manage customer information.
- **Project and Work Tracking**: Users can track work performed on individual projects or for specific customers.
- **Invoicing**: Users can issue invoices to their customers.
- **Bank Account Statements**: Users can enter account statements issued by the bank.
- **Invoice Tracking**: Users can track paid and unpaid invoices by pairing them with account statements.

### Development Process

The entire application is developed using generative AI. The purpose of this application is to learn and evaluate generative AI tools for writing software.

The work is divided into a series of lessons:
- In each lesson, we develop one feature at some state of the application.
- The goal of each lesson is to apply the generative AI tools to develop the requested feature.

By following this structured approach, we aim to explore the capabilities and limitations of generative AI in software development.

*Note: This README has also been generated by a generative AI tool.*

## Before the Workshop Begins

## Working With Lesson Branches

Each lesson in the workshop has dedicated branches. You can list all the lessons using the command:

```
git branch
```

These are the branches every lesson has:
- `lesson-NN-topic` - the main branch on which the lesson is developed; initially corresponds to the state of the `main` branch at the time when the lesson starts. You can make changes to this branch as you develop a solution to the lesson.
- `lesson-NN-completed` - the state of the code with the official solution applied; this branch is kept separate from the *regular* branch for the lesson, so that each attendee can make own changes to the code and then compare it to the officially suggested solution (which, to be noted, might not be better than yours in any respect).

There is a tag defined, in the format `lesson-NN-start`, which marks the initial state of the lesson's branch. You can always checkout this state using the command:

```
git checkout lesson-NN-start
```

This will bring your Git repository into a detached HEAD state. If checking out by tag, you can either create a new branch to commit any changes, or stash them for later use.

## Lesson 01: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

To begin the lesson, checkout the branch `lesson-01-prompt-engineering-fundamentals`:

```
git switch lesson-01-prompt-engineering-fundamentals
```

*This lesson* is teaching the fundamental principles of constructing prompts for the generative AI tools. The techniques you will learn include:
- Defining the context, verifications, and the output format
- Specifying the requests
- Instructing the tool to prepare the plan of action

*Your task* is to make changes to the UI.
- Start from the existing `Index.cshtml`
- Use an AI tool to ensure that the page, with all its elements, is rendered using a dark theme.

## Lesson 02: Scaffolding with Gen AI

To begin the lesson, checkout the branch `lesson-02-scaffolding`:

```
git switch lesson-02-scaffolding
```

*This lesson* is teaching the virtue of using AI to integrate Microsoft Identity library into the ASP.NET Core application. There are many sensitive steps to make in order to scaffold the use of Identity. These tasks can be performed effectively using AI tools, so to replace a human in implementing tedious and brittle steps.

*The request* in this lesson is to implement authentication (login/logout features only), where users are managed in the local database.

*Your task* is to make changes to the application:
- Add necessary packages to the project, to support everything required by Microsoft Identity
- Scaffold the database schema to support Identity
- Make changes to the `_Layout.cshtml` to support login/logout features
- Implement Login/Logout pages that utilize Identity to manage users

# Money Flow Application

## Purpose

**Money Flow** is a web application designed to help businesses manage their customer relationships and financial transactions efficiently.

### Features
- **User Authentication**: Multiple users can sign in to the application.
- **Customer Management**: Users can track their customers and manage customer information.
- **Project and Work Tracking**: Users can track work performed on individual projects or for specific customers.
- **Invoicing**: Users can issue invoices to their customers.
- **Bank Account Statements**: Users can enter account statements issued by the bank.
- **Invoice Tracking**: Users can track paid and unpaid invoices by pairing them with account statements.

### Development Process

The entire application is developed using generative AI. The purpose of this application is to learn and evaluate generative AI tools for writing software.

The work is divided into a series of lessons:
- In each lesson, we develop one feature at some state of the application.
- The goal of each lesson is to apply the generative AI tools to develop the requested feature.

By following this structured approach, we aim to explore the capabilities and limitations of generative AI in software development.

*Note: This README has also been generated by a generative AI tool.*

## Lesson 01: Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

To begin the lesson, checkout the tag `lesson-01-start`:

```
git checkout lesson-01-start
```

Your Git repository will be in a detached HEAD state. You can either create a new branch to commit your changes, or stash them for later use.

In this lesson, your task is to make changes to the UI.
- Start from the existing `Index.cshtml`
- Use an AI tool to ensure that the page, with all its elements, is rendered using a dark theme.
